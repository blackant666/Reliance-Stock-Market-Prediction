# Reliance-Stock-Market-Prediction
💹Predication of Reliance Stock Price Project.


<h3>Hey Folks,👨🏻‍💻</h3>
<p>I have created a stock market price prediction program that can predict the stock price of any company for the next 30 days. Here I used the last 7 years' data of Reliance Industries Limited. I did this project during my internship</p>

# Data
### If you want to download the data.

- You need to download Anaconda to install Jupyter notebook in your system. After the download is completed. You have to install it just like normal software. Anaconda is a combination of multiple IDEs. You'll find Jupyter Notebook there. Just open that and start your coding.
